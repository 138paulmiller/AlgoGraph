# AlgoGraph
A Processing 3 Application used to visualize and demonstrate algorithms on graphs. 
Designed for Quick Visual Solutions to algorithms on an undirected Graph. 

### UI Controls
1. Left Click
  * to drag vertices
  * toggle selection
2. Right Click
  * to open menus
  * right click on vertex for vertex options
  * right click in space for other options

#### Usage
##### To add vertex
* Right click in space, then click position destination
##### To add edge
* Right click vertex, then left click the connecting vertex
* Once added, user can use the key pad and backspace to update value
* if edge already exists, edge value is just updated
##### To run algorithm
 * Left click on the menu, some algorithms may weight until another vertex is selected
